#### Project description

This project is a fully functional application which simulates an online Etsy-style store, with individual merchants who each 
have their own stock of items. One can visit each Merchant's dashboard, which links to their item stock, which links to show pages 
for the particular item you want to view. There are statistics available on some pages for revenue generated by items and the top 
items's best day, as well as the top customers for that merchant. As a merchant, one can enable or disable items in their stock, 
add new items, edit existing ones, as well as view items that are ready to ship. One can also view one's invoices.

One can also visit the site as an administrator. Admins can add, edit, enable, or disable Merchants, view invoices, whether 
complete or incomplete, view top customers by number of transactions, manage invoices, view total revenue, and show the best
dates for the top 5 merchants on the site, with their total revenue generated.

Overall this site makes use of a SQL database seeded by CSV data in order to efficiently store and retrieve data for a hypothetical
online commerce platform. The work was split between the four contributors listed above in 9 days. 

<u>Ideas for how this could be improved by incoming contributors:</u>

There are some missing links. We added a welcome page, but it's missing the ability to checkout merchant pages so that information
has to be entered in the url. An option for admins to delete merchants could be added, but that might not be necessary since they can 
currently be disabled, which is reversible. The same could be said of Merchants' items. Another thing that should be added in a fully
deployed version of this app would be the ability to sign in and authenticate oneself as a merchant or administrator. The most obvious 
refactor would be that the styling on the page is relatively rudimentary. Since this project was primarily focused on backend functionality,
the UI leaves something to be desired (although we're all proud of the work that we put in).
